Stuff I've written down while transitioning between static site generators. If you have any corrections or suggestions (specifically for the guide), please reach out using the issue tracker, or message me on Twitter/Reddit (same username).

1. ad-hoc-polymorphism.rst - An informal and incomplete survey of the design
   space for ad-hoc polymorphism in a programming language.

2. opinionated-haskell-guide-2019.md - A guide for Haskell beginners in mid
   2019. TL:DR; Prefer simple and well-documented options over exciting things.
   Ask for help when stuck.
