Stuff I've written down while transitioning between static site generators. If you have any corrections or suggestions, please reach out using the issue tracker, or message me on Twitter/Reddit (same username).

1. ad-hoc-polymorphism.rst - An informal and incomplete survey of the design
   space for ad-hoc polymorphism in a programming language.

2. opinionated-haskell-guide-2019.md - A guide for Haskell beginners in mid
   2019. TL:DR; Prefer simple and well-documented options over exciting things.
   Ask for help when stuck.

3. pl-and-physics-jargon.md - A small post describing how the jargon used for
   name binding in programming languages is somewhat similar to the jargon used
   in some parts of physics. Don't take it too seriously.
